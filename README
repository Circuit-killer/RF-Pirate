RF Pirate project
Elliot Buller 2011-2012

This project is based on a atmega32u4 microcontroller connected to the 
silabs 4432 ISM transceiver. There is also a 128 x 64 oled display ssd1306
and a microsd card.

The intention is to have a very low-cost platform to experiment with various
radio protocols. The Si4432 is capable of OOK, FSK and GFSK. With minor front
end tuning it should be possible to communicate with many low speed RF
protocols.

Above all I hope people can use and improve this in ways I never intended!
